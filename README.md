# This branch will be used to deploy changes to the website to the gh-pages branch #
The website is built using mkdocs. Markdown files are stored in the docs folder. The mkdocs.yml file contains extensions and plugins which assist with writing markdown. In the nav section of this document, the files for the different pages are listed so that when the website is built, they are accessible from the index page.
To find out how to build the website and deploy it to github, look at the following information https://www.mkdocs.org . Make sure that when editing the website you have cd'd into your folder containing the repository and that you have the contents of the SiteDevelopment branch.

The website uses the theme Material for mkdocs. This will need to be installed. See https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/
