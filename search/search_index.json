We are developing a questionnaire to ask the client about system and user requirements so that we can continue with the requirements section and to prepare for the implementation section of our project Some issues that we might run into are misunderstanding the difference between functional and non-functional requirements, but as long as we carefully consider them and refer back to the lecture slides, this risk can be mitigated. We also must avoid the use of technical jargon in the interviews since we are assuming our clients are not technical. In order to ensure this, we will discuss the appropriateness of our questions between us first. After this meeting, we should have a complete interview template for our client for our meeting tomorrow. For next week, we will plan to have requirements section finished with the help of 4 project members. As well as this, we will designate tasks for the completion of risks and methods over the first few weeks of the Christmas break to continue with the progress of our assessment. Implementation will continue to occur with our dev team over the break and during all this time. All team members present November 24th We have gathered enough information from the client meeting with Tommy to get the complete product description that would help us to construct the user and system requirements for the game. We have also split the group into two - one group for requirements, one group for development of the game. Both groups are working on to finish each group\u2019s tasks. User/System Requirements Group Involved - Jack Vickers, Hubert Solecki, Azzam Amirul Bahri Abstracted and decomposed interview notes and assessment documents into user requirements, and repeated this process for the system requirements. Dev Group Sam Toner implemented an abstraction for the sound system and pushed it onto the dev branch Jack Hinton started the implementation of the recipe system building off the previous item factory system Felix started work on the pathfinding system for movement.
