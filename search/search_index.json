Therefore, there should be no issue in completing the scenario Success Postcondition: The player has completed the scenario and receives a score that qualifies for the leaderboard They either decide to integrate their score into the leaderboard, at which point the leaderboard is updated and displayed to the user; Or, the user decides not to integrate their score into the leaderboard and their score is displayed alongside the leaderboard The player is redirected to the main menu Minimal Postcondition: The player has completed the scenario poorly/averagely and receives a score They either decide to integrate their score into the leaderboard, at which point the leaderboard is updated and displayed to the user; Or, the user decides not to integrate their score into the leaderboard and their score is displayed alongside the leaderboard The player is redirected to the main menu Use case diagram for playing the game (version 1) During development, we decided, we decided that highscores would be easier to display from the menu. The diagram below shows this change. Through further evaluation, we decided to display the whole transition diagram in the use case to make development easier later. Use case for playing the game (updated version) Use Case: Mute Sound and Music Primary Actor: User/Player Supporting Actors: N/A Precondition: Game has started Trigger: The user does not want to hear the music or sounds within the game Main Success Scenario: During the game, the user easily located the buttons in the top corners of the screen that switch off game music and sounds The user points the mouse at the buttons and presses them The sounds and music switch off and the display of the button changes to ensure the user knows the buttons have been pressed Secondary Scenarios: The user cannot find the clearly displayed buttons and continues to play the game with music and sounds Success Postcondition: The sound and music will stop while the game is playing as to not irritate the user if they have decided to turn them off; the game will continue without any implications Minimal Postcondition: The sound and music will continue to play while the user is playing the game, which may irritate the user or entertain them Use case for muting game sound Use Case: Cook Food Primary Actor: Cook (Player) Supporting Actors: Customers (Non-playable character) Precondition: Game has started Trigger: The cook has received orders from customers Main Success Scenario: The cook collects ingredients from the pantry The cook brings ingredient to designated workstations The cook cooks the food on time at designated workstations The cook assembles ingredients before serving food to customers The cook serves food to customers Secondary Scenarios: 1.1 The cook does not collect the ingredients before going to workstations 1.1.1 A reminder alert appears to remind cook to collect ingredients 1.2 The cook collects the wrong ingredients 1.2.1 A reminder alert appears telling the cook to collect the right ingredients 2.1 The cook brings the ingredients to wrong workstations 2.1.1 An alert appears that tells the cook to bring ingredients to go to the right workstation 2.2 The cook drops ingredients before reaching workstations 2.2.1 An alert appears telling the cook to collect ingredients from the pantry 3.1 The cook takes too long to cook food 3.1.1 The cook has to redo the process from the start eg: collect ingredients, bring the ingredients to the workstation, etc. 3.2 The cook takes too little time to cook food 3.2.1 The cook has to redo the process from the start eg: collect ingredients, bring the ingredients to the workstation, etc. 4.1 The cook does not assemble the ingredients before serving food to customers 4.1.1 An alert appears saying food cannot be served to customers and must be assembled before serving.

What is the target audience? Cooking game playable by anyone in the audience, parents, children but mainly sixth formers who want to joining the university as an advertisement scheme to show off the comp sci department. Below-average users What do you want to happen in a scenario? Do they order the same food each attempt? Random (same every time acceptable) Maybe slight randomisation Does the user select what food they order? Customer chooses (randomly generated in game) How much food should a customer order? Do you want a difficulty option? Can if we want but implement possibly in assessment 2 What sort of recipes do you want Keep the same for assessment 1 in terms of stations and food; should be simple in terms of no customisation for food (same recipe for assessment 1). Can change in assessment 2 to add more ingredients from possibly more stations What sort of stations should exist Keep the same for assessment 1 but can possible develop in assessment 2 How long should a scenario be? Get them to play for 5-7 minutes. \u201cPlay one game and then they win the game\u201d. Work out the timings to serve a customer What do you want to be seen on screen? Customers ect Show the customers. Goes through door to counter. Easily accesible Do you want events such as the kitchen catching fire that the player will have to deal with. Assessment 2 to implement How should the player deal with these Assessment 2 possibility, but interaction is key. Could potentially think about putting it into assessment 1 to check how things work Should the game have a pause menu? - People are playing for a few minutes, so not needed but could be added Is there a saving system in scenarios to allow for breaks?- Progress to buy more work stations or cooks. Happen within the gameplay. Assessment 2 Is there progress between games e.g. high score or upgrades? - Leaderboard optional but interesting Should tell the player something after a game Should the game be turn based or real time? Real time How do you want to control characters in the game? Use mouse to be able to switch between characters when clicked on, and then use keyboard to control them; whatever is most comfortable for the user in our opinion Do you want the users to interact with items in workstations e.g. minigames? Basic keyboard interactions to interact with the workstations How do you want to interact with stations? Decide between minigames in slow-time or quick actions in quick-time What kind of sound effects do you want in the game? Should there be music? Some effects to be more exciting. Make sure sound is mutable in settings Do you want a tutorial? On screen instructions before the game starts. Probably have the game teach you how to play as you start How do you know that you've won the game/its finished Have animations play out or pop ups Do you want a settings option? What do you want in it? In pause menu or on screen during game time Do you want different kitchens Assessment 2 Should chefs look different than each other? Should they have different abilities? Should you be able to customise them skins or abilities? Maybe slightly different. Assessment two for abilities Would be fine to make it customisable, but not necessary Do you want physics in the game? E.g. being able to interact with objects Assessment 2 possibility to make game more difficult How should the camera frame the game? Should it be Orthographic like early pokemon games or perspective with depth. Either way is fine, choose depending on how scalable the game is in terms of screen size Do you want a start menu? Can implement to make the game more exciting, can implement as we please in either assessments What systems should the game run on? Minimum Frames Per Second? Windows/Mac/Linux Experiment with different FPS to see which is the most exciting (We have to pick as the customer did not understand the question) Is there any information that we missed that you want in the game specifically? Can catch up any time in practical sessions Context to the game People in the public from A level coming to university of york open days Playing for only a few minutes \u201c5-6\u201d minutes. Give some decent experience Second part only 10 minutes (assessment 2) Should be scalable Different operating systems - linux and mac and windows Customers - sixth form students and younger family Be able to display on large screens. But also laptops Dynamic Resolutions Be playable by young children but also older, low violence, less blood.

We encountered the risk (R10 Unable to meet in person) that not all team members were present; we mitigated this by ensuring good communication and having Sam in the meeting on discord. This allowed us to bypass the risk and continue our work; however, we had to push back our analyse documents requirement deadline by one day to check progress. Felix Seanor Jack Vickers Hubert Solecki Jack Hinton Azzam Amirul Bahri not present November 17th, Discuss GitHubPages and decide on who is going to be in charge of the website Decided for everyone to watch the requirements lectures before a meeting on the 23rd November to plan for our client meeting and discuss the questions we will ask Discuss a plan for the coming weeks to ensure we are on schedule: Requirements Risks Methods Discuss and finalise team structure All team members present Autumn Week 9 Progress Update November 23rd Jack Vickers has improved the website and learnt further about how to add files and updates to the website Everyone has completed the user requirements lectures Everyone is working on the user requirements interview planning before tomorrow\u2019s client meeting. We are developing a questionnaire to ask the client about system and user requirements so that we can continue with the requirements section and to prepare for the implementation section of our project Some issues that we might run into are misunderstanding the difference between functional and non-functional requirements, but as long as we carefully consider them and refer back to the lecture slides, this risk can be mitigated. We also must avoid the use of technical jargon in the interviews since we are assuming our clients are not technical. In order to ensure this, we will discuss the appropriateness of our questions between us first. After this meeting, we should have a complete interview template for our client for our meeting tomorrow. For next week, we will plan to have requirements section finished with the help of 4 project members. As well as this, we will designate tasks for the completion of risks and methods over the first few weeks of the Christmas break to continue with the progress of our assessment. Implementation will continue to occur with our dev team over the break and during all this time. All team members present November 24th We have gathered enough information from the client meeting with Tommy to get the complete product description that would help us to construct the user and system requirements for the game. We have also split the group into two - one group for requirements, one group for development of the game. Both groups are working on to finish each group\u2019s tasks. User/System Requirements Group Involved - Jack Vickers, Hubert Solecki, Azzam Amirul Bahri Abstracted and decomposed interview notes and assessment documents into user requirements, and repeated this process for the system requirements. Dev Group Sam Toner implemented an abstraction for the sound system and pushed it onto the dev branch Jack Hinton started the implementation of the recipe system building off the previous item factory system Felix started work on the pathfinding system for movement. All team members present Autumn Week 10 Progress Update November 30th Decide who is assigned to each deliverable and allocate portions of each so that everyone\u2019s mark-goal is reached. User/ System Requirements Group Jack Vickers, Azzam Amirul Bahri and Hubert Solecki added more functional and non-functional requirements to the requirements document. All team members present. December 1st User/ System Requirements Group Jack Vickers, Hubert Solecki, and Azzam Amirul Bahri continued working on the requirements document. More functional and non-functional requirements have been added and an explanation of how requirements were elicited has been written. A general use case has been added by Azzam as well as an accompanying UML diagram. Dev group Sam Toner, Felix Seanor, and Jack Hinton continued to work on the implementation of the game. Website - Jack Vickers changed the colour scheme of the website All team members present. Christmas Break Updates All of these meetings were done over Discord via voice chat and screen sharing. This was to mitigate risk R10 (Unable to meet in person). We did not update the gantt chart over this time. We recorded progression and updated gantt chart on return. December 5th The team discussed the position that we are all in in terms of our delegated tasks, and discussed a plan to develop a document for risks and risks management by the end of the week. We decided to have another meeting to discuss, write up and distribute risks to manage on Friday, before a team officially writes up the document on the weekend post-meeting. All team members present. December 7th The Dev Team (Felix Seanor, Sam Toner, and Jack Hinton) met to show each other what we have achieved over the past week. Sams code was changed from using hashmaps to vector2\u2019s. We discussed the plans on how to do certain things with the code, and when it should be done by. Deciding to set the deadline for the collisions detection for the 13th, any further physics work is due for the 20th And the rest of the currently ongoing code, for the 20th December 9th The team came together to discover potential risks and find mitigation for them. We then assigned owners to each risk based on familiarity and expertise. Each risk along with mitigations, likelihood and severity ratings were written on Google Sheets Jack Vickers, Hubert Solecki, Azzam Amirul Bahri discussed how to structure the write-up of the risks in the documentation and distributed different sections amongst themselves. All team members present December 13th Documentation team meeting: Jack Vickers, Hubert Solecki, and Azzam Amirul Bahri peer-reviewed the written risk management document and adjusted where necessary by adding more information, reducing the size of the document and checking the writing. Also planned our next meeting to start on a new section of the project. Dev team meeting: Peer-reviewed each others code Sam Toner decided to add a new queue to the physics to separate static and dynamic objects. He discovered how to test if physics shapes are overlapping Jack Hinton exhibited his factory and combination code. It allows for dynamic crafting however we need to be careful not to introduce recipes with more than 4 items. Sam Toner plans to finish off physics before our deadline of the 20th Felix Seanor will add in the customer queue system Jack Hinton will be performing testing of his code to make sure there aren't any issues before integration and play testing. Plan to meet this Friday for a short meeting before the deadline. December 18th Documentation Team discussed the method selection and planning section and agreed that it would be completed after exams when the team returned to York so that members could focus on exam preparation. The risk of not completing this work was mitigated by assigning more time to work on it in January. Spring Week 1 Progress Update January 17th - The team have come together after the break and exams and are going forward with the rest of the project. - In this meeting we focus on completing another part of the deliverables which is the Method Selection and Planning as well as the Architecture of the project. - We are also uploading the code into the main Dev Branch in GitHub. - Everyone was present January 19th - We continued working on the method selection and planning document, specifically the section detailing the software development methodology and development/ collaboration tools that the team has used. - Hubert Solecki, Felix Seanor worked on the gantt chart for the project. - Sam Toner,Jack Hinton, Felix Seanor continued working on the development. January 20th - Jack Vickers,Azzam Amirul Bahri completed their section of the method selection and planning document. - Jack Vickers added some new pages to the team\u2019s website and researched how to format images with mkdocs. - Hubert Solecki,Felix Seanor continued to work on the Gantt chart - Sam Toner,Jack Hinton,Felix Seanor continued to work on the development and added to the architecture deliverable. Spring Week 2 Progress Update January 21st - The whole team had a brief meeting over discord to discuss what each person needed to add to the game. The team previously working on documentation will now be focussing on development until their sections are complete. January 23rd - January 31st - The team had meetings every weekday and worked on the development of the game in order to finish it in time. - Everyone was present for all meetings held Spring Weeks 3 and 4 Progress Update January 30th and January 31st - The whole team met and finalised deliverables. - Website was updated with everything needed for the Assessment 1 hand-in","title":"Weekly Updates"},{"location":"weeklyGantt/","text":"Weekly Gantt Chart Snapshots Right-click images and open in new tab to zoom in Note: Each section's images run continuously in the actual gantt chart but have been put on a new line to fit them on the page Final Snapshot Of The Gantt Chart Download link for final gantt chart Autumn week 7 snapshot Autumn week 8 snapshot Autumn week 9 snapshot Autumn week 10 snapshot As mentioned in weekly updates section, gantt chart was not updated over Christmas Break Spring week 1 snapshot Spring week 2 snapshot Spring week 2 snapshot Spring week 4 snapshot","title":"Weekly Gantt Chart Snapshots"}]}
