What is the target audience? Cooking game playable by anyone in the audience, parents, children but mainly sixth formers who want to joining the university as an advertisement scheme to show off the comp sci department. Below-average users What do you want to happen in a scenario? Do they order the same food each attempt? Random (same every time acceptable) Maybe slight randomisation Does the user select what food they order? Customer chooses (randomly generated in game) How much food should a customer order? Do you want a difficulty option? Can if we want but implement possibly in assessment 2 What sort of recipes do you want Keep the same for assessment 1 in terms of stations and food; should be simple in terms of no customisation for food (same recipe for assessment 1). Can change in assessment 2 to add more ingredients from possibly more stations What sort of stations should exist Keep the same for assessment 1 but can possible develop in assessment 2 How long should a scenario be? Get them to play for 5-7 minutes. \u201cPlay one game and then they win the game\u201d. Work out the timings to serve a customer What do you want to be seen on screen? Customers ect Show the customers. Goes through door to counter. Easily accesible Do you want events such as the kitchen catching fire that the player will have to deal with. Assessment 2 to implement How should the player deal with these Assessment 2 possibility, but interaction is key. Could potentially think about putting it into assessment 1 to check how things work Should the game have a pause menu? - People are playing for a few minutes, so not needed but could be added Is there a saving system in scenarios to allow for breaks?- Progress to buy more work stations or cooks. Happen within the gameplay. Assessment 2 Is there progress between games e.g. high score or upgrades? - Leaderboard optional but interesting Should tell the player something after a game Should the game be turn based or real time? Real time How do you want to control characters in the game? Use mouse to be able to switch between characters when clicked on, and then use keyboard to control them; whatever is most comfortable for the user in our opinion Do you want the users to interact with items in workstations e.g. minigames? Basic keyboard interactions to interact with the workstations How do you want to interact with stations? Decide between minigames in slow-time or quick actions in quick-time What kind of sound effects do you want in the game? Should there be music? Some effects to be more exciting. Make sure sound is mutable in settings Do you want a tutorial? On screen instructions before the game starts. Probably have the game teach you how to play as you start How do you know that you've won the game/its finished Have animations play out or pop ups Do you want a settings option? What do you want in it? In pause menu or on screen during game time Do you want different kitchens Assessment 2 Should chefs look different than each other? Should they have different abilities? Should you be able to customise them skins or abilities? Maybe slightly different. Assessment two for abilities Would be fine to make it customisable, but not necessary Do you want physics in the game? E.g. being able to interact with objects Assessment 2 possibility to make game more difficult How should the camera frame the game? Should it be Orthographic like early pokemon games or perspective with depth. Either way is fine, choose depending on how scalable the game is in terms of screen size Do you want a start menu? Can implement to make the game more exciting, can implement as we please in either assessments What systems should the game run on? Minimum Frames Per Second? Windows/Mac/Linux Experiment with different FPS to see which is the most exciting (We have to pick as the customer did not understand the question) Is there any information that we missed that you want in the game specifically? Can catch up any time in practical sessions Context to the game People in the public from A level coming to university of york open days Playing for only a few minutes \u201c5-6\u201d minutes. Give some decent experience Second part only 10 minutes (assessment 2) Should be scalable Different operating systems - linux and mac and windows Customers - sixth form students and younger family Be able to display on large screens. But also laptops Dynamic Resolutions Be playable by young children but also older, low violence, less blood.

We are developing a questionnaire to ask the client about system and user requirements so that we can continue with the requirements section and to prepare for the implementation section of our project Some issues that we might run into are misunderstanding the difference between functional and non-functional requirements, but as long as we carefully consider them and refer back to the lecture slides, this risk can be mitigated. We also must avoid the use of technical jargon in the interviews since we are assuming our clients are not technical. In order to ensure this, we will discuss the appropriateness of our questions between us first. After this meeting, we should have a complete interview template for our client for our meeting tomorrow. For next week, we will plan to have requirements section finished with the help of 4 project members. As well as this, we will designate tasks for the completion of risks and methods over the first few weeks of the Christmas break to continue with the progress of our assessment. Implementation will continue to occur with our dev team over the break and during all this time. All team members present November 24th We have gathered enough information from the client meeting with Tommy to get the complete product description that would help us to construct the user and system requirements for the game. We have also split the group into two - one group for requirements, one group for development of the game. Both groups are working on to finish each group\u2019s tasks. User/System Requirements Group Involved - Jack Vickers, Hubert Solecki, Azzam Amirul Bahri Abstracted and decomposed interview notes and assessment documents into user requirements, and repeated this process for the system requirements. Dev Group Sam Toner implemented an abstraction for the sound system and pushed it onto the dev branch Jack Hinton started the implementation of the recipe system building off the previous item factory system Felix started work on the pathfinding system for movement. All team members present Week 3 Progress Update November 30th Decide who is assigned to each deliverable and allocate portions of each so that everyone\u2019s mark-goal is reached. User/ System Requirements Group Jack Vickers, Azzam Amirul Bahri and Hubert Solecki added more functional and non-functional requirements to the requirements document. All team members present. December 1st User/ System Requirements Group Jack Vickers, Hubert Solecki, and Azzam Amirul Bahri continued working on the requirements document. More functional and non-functional requirements have been added and an explanation of how requirements were elicited has been written. A general use case has been added by Azzam as well as an accompanying UML diagram. Dev group Sam Toner, Felix Seanor, and Jack Hinton continued to work on the implementation of the game. Website - Jack Vickers changed the colour scheme of the website All team members present. Christmas Break Updates All of these meetings were done over Discord via voice chat. December 5th The team discussed the position that we are all in in terms of our delegated tasks, and discussed a plan to develop a document for risks and risks management by the end of the week. We decided to have another meeting to discuss, write up and distribute risks to manage on Friday, before a team officially writes up the document on the weekend post-meeting. All team members present. December 7th The Dev Team (Felix Seanor, Sam Toner, and Jack Hinton) met to show each other what we have achieved over the past week. Sams code was changed from using hashmaps to vector2\u2019s. We discussed the plans on how to do certain things with the code, and when it should be done by. Deciding to set the deadline for the collisions detection for the 13th, any further physics work is due for the 20th And the rest of the currently ongoing code, for the 20th December 9th The team came together to discover potential risks and find mitigation for them. We then assigned owners to each risk based on familiarity and expertise. Each risk along with mitigations, likelihood and severity ratings were written on Google Sheets Jack Vickers, Hubert Solecki, Azzam Amirul Bahri discussed how to structure the write-up of the risks in the documentation and distributed different sections amongst themselves. All team members present December 13th Documentation team meeting: Jack Vickers, Hubert Solecki, and Azzam Amirul Bahri peer-reviewed the written risk management document and adjusted where necessary by adding more information, reducing the size of the document and checking the writing. Also planned our next meeting to start on a new section of the project. Dev team meeting: Peer-reviewed each others code Sam Toner decided to add a new queue to the physics to separate static and dynamic objects. He discovered how to test if physics shapes are overlapping Jack Hinton exhibited his factory and combination code. It allows for dynamic crafting however we need to be careful not to introduce recipes with more than 4 items. Sam Toner plans to finish off physics before our deadline of the 20th Felix Seanor will add in the customer queue system Jack Hinton will be performing testing of his code to make sure there aren't any issues before integration and play testing. Plan to meet this Friday for a short meeting before the deadline. December 18th Documentation Team discussed the method selection and planning section and agreed that it would be completed after exams when the team returned to York so that members could focus on exam preparation.","title":"Weekly Updates"}]}
