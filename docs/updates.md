<h2>Week 2 Progress Update </h2>
<h3>November 23rd</h3>
* Jack Vickers has improved the website and learnt further about how to add files and updates to the website
* Everyone has completed the user requirements lectures
* Everyone is working on the user requirements interview planning before tomorrow’s client meeting.
* We are developing a questionnaire to ask the client about system and user requirements so that we can continue with the requirements section and to prepare for the implementation section of our project
Some issues that we might run into are misunderstanding the difference between functional and non-functional requirements, 
but as long as we carefully consider them and refer back to the lecture slides, this risk can be mitigated. 
We also must avoid the use of technical jargon in the interviews since we are assuming our clients are not technical. 
In order to ensure this, we will discuss the appropriateness of our questions between us first.
* After this meeting, we should have a complete interview template for our client for our meeting tomorrow.
* For next week, we will plan to have requirements section finished with the help of 4 project members. As well as this, we will designate tasks for the completion of risks and methods over the first few weeks of the Christmas break to continue with the progress of our assessment. Implementation will continue to occur with our dev team over the break and during all this time.
